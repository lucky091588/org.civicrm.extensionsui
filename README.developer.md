# TODOS really:
  - Decide if we're really ready to launch this (as a beta?(

# TODO
 - How about some tests for local-only extensions?
 - How about some tests against the remote and local subarrays? (We should find
   that the current code is now (or again?) clobbering the remote values when
   items go through the local loop. See next section)

# Coalescing Specification

Notes from a 2018-03-22 meeting between Allen and Frank. Stashed in this repo
for safekeeping and convenience, these notes can be deleted when they are no
longer needed.

## Fields where both local and remote values should be returned

- version: needed to indicate when upgrades are available
- requires: need to know what dependencies there are in case I've broken my
    local instance by manually installing an extension without its dependencies;
    want to know about new dependencies before I upgrade in-app
- releaseDate: just how out of date am I?

## Fields where local values should trump remote values
- status
- name
- description
- urls
- license
- maintainer
- comments
- path
- statusLabel (probably with heavy massaging from this API)

## Fields that ought not be in the API result at all
- id: the extension (database) ID
- type: deprecated and not something we want to display anyway
- label: despite its name, this is not expected to be used for human-readable display
- file
- classloader
- compatibility: the extensions microservice shouldn't tell me about extensions
    that aren't compatible with my instance
- civix
- downloadUrl
- develStage
- typeInfo

## Matching
- key: used to match results from `Extension.get` and `Extension.getRemote`
